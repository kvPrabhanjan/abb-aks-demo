# AKS Store Demo

This sample demo app consists of a group of containerized microservices that can be easily deployed into an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This is meant to show a realistic scenario using a polyglot architecture, event-driven design, and common open source back-end services (eg - RabbitMQ, MongoDB). The application also leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 models to generate product descriptions. This can be done using either [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).


## Architecture

The application has the following services: 

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `makeline-service` | This service handles processing orders from the queue and completing them (Golang) |
| `order-service` | This service is used for placing orders (Javascript) |
| `product-service` | This service is used to perform CRUD operations on products (Rust) |
| `store-front` | Web app for customers to place orders (Vue.js) |
| `store-admin` | Web app used by store employees to view orders in queue and manage products (Vue.js) | 
| `virtual-customer` | Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis (Rust) |
| `virtual-worker` | Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis (Rust) |
| `ai-service` | Optional service for adding generative text and graphics creation (Python) |
| `mongodb` | MongoDB instance for persisted data |
| `rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ for an order queue |
